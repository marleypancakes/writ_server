# Backend Server for Writ.js

Currently being hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), this REST API receives requests from [Writ.js](https://github.com/marleypancakes/writ/), retrieves page history data from the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), calculates diffs, and sends the diffed page body back to the extension to be injected in the page.
